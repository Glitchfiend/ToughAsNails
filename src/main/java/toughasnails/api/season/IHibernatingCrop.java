/**
 * An interface which should be implemented by crops which become inactive in
 * the winter in the absence of proper heating.
 * 
 * Crops using this interface in 1.10 should make sure they use Forge's crop
 * growth events and appropriately cancel the crop growth when the event result
 * is set to DENY. (See net.minecraftforge.event.BlockEvent$CropGrowEvent or
 * alternatively net.minecraftforge.common.ForgeHooks.onCropsGrowPre)
 * 
 * Please note that due to how Java bytecode works, you must explicitly
 * implement this interface if your class overrides updateTick.
